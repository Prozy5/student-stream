    <span class="badge">Founder Story</span>

    <p>
      Deondre is the owner and founder of the technology company StudentStream — a multi-division platform built to give creators real ownership, real protection, and real opportunity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea for StudentStream didn’t start as a company. It started as frustration: creators working hard, building audiences, and producing valuable content, yet losing control to platforms that dictated the rules, the revenue, and the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of waiting for change, Deondre decided to build it.
    </p>

    <p>
      What began as a vision for a fair streaming platform evolved into a full ecosystem — combining media, production tools, legal systems, and investigative storytelling under one structure designed for long-term independence.
    </p>

    <p>
      StudentStream was created not just to host content, but to change how creators are treated in the digital economy.

    <span class="badge">Letter from the Founder</span>

    <div class="letter">
      <p>
        StudentStream was never meant to be just another platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was built because too many creators are stuck in systems that profit from their work while limiting their freedom. Systems where ownership is taken, voices are controlled, and futures are negotiated away.
      </p>

      <p>
        SS Films is our first public step. A place where independent filmmakers and storytellers can release original work, grow real audiences, and earn without losing control of what they create.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this goes deeper than streaming.
      </p>

      <p>
        StudentStream is about building infrastructure that creators can rely on — technology, legal protection, production tools, and platforms designed for long-term independence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every division exists to solve a problem creators have faced for years.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are building something that doesn’t disappear overnight. Something that belongs to the people who create.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is only the beginning.
      </p>

    <span class="badge">Vision</span>

    <p>
      StudentStream is being built as a long-term technology and infrastructure company — not just a streaming service.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mission is to give independent creators the same power, tools, protection, and leverage as major studios — without sacrificing ownership.
