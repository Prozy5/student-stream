  <h1>StudentStream</h1>

  <p class="subtitle">
    StudentStream is a startup technology company building a digital platform for emerging creators
    and young entrepreneurs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our goal is to help people get discovered, grow their audience, and turn creative work into real opportunities.
    While major platforms promote creators who are already famous, StudentStream is built to highlight smaller
    creators first — giving them a fair chance to be seen, connect with supporters, collaborate with others,
    and earn from what they create.
